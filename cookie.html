		<h2>PONDDY COOKIE POLICY</h2>
		<h6>Last Updated: Aug 27th, 2019</h6>

		<p>
			This policy explains our use of cookies and other technologies to understand, improve and protect
			Ponddy Reader. If you see a capitalized word, it's defined in our
			<a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ponddyreader-master/legal_documents/terms.html" target="_blank">
				Terms of Use
			</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>
			What they are
		</h3>
		<p>
			Cookies are small data files that are issued to your device when you visit a website and that store
			information about your use of a service. Pixel tags (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or
			pixels) are little snippets of code or tiny images embedded on websites and in email that help us learn how
			you interact with our site and emails.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Why we use them
		</h3>
		<p>
			Ponddy Reader uses cookies and these other technologies to help recognize you as a repeat visitor and, to
			improve the quality of our Services.
		</p>

		<h3>
			How they work
		</h3>
		<p>
			When you visit Ponddy Reader, our web server sends a cookie to your device, which allows us to recognize your
			device (but not the specific person using it). By associating the identification numbers in the cookies with
			other account information when, for example, you log in to our Services, we know that the cookie information
			relates to your user account. Similarly, pixel tags on Ponddy Reader and in email communications help us
			identify how your device is being used to interact with Ponddy Reader content. Some of the tags and cookies
			used by our Services are served by us, and some are served by trusted partners who are delivering services
			on our behalf.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some examples of the types of cookies and other technologies Ponddy Reader uses:
		</p>
		<div class="work">
			<h4>Authentication</h4>
			<p>
				Ponddy Reader uses authentication cookies and similar technologies to tell us when you're logged in to
				Ponddy Reader. This lets us show you personalized views related to your interests and connect you with
				projects like those you may already have backed.
			</p>

			<h4>Security</h4>
			<p>
				Cookies also help keep Ponddy Reader secure by facilitating security features and allowing us to detect
				activity that might violate our rules and
				<a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ponddyreader-master/legal_documents/terms.html"
					target="_blank">
					Terms of Use
				</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				These cookies help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you, alert you and us
				when your account is accessed, and provide capabilities that allow us to disable any active sessions you
				have (for example, when you log out or change your password).
			</p>

			<h4>Localization</h4>
			<p>
				Some cookies help us provide localized experiences — for example, by making sure you see Ponddy Reader in
				your preferred language.
			</p>

			<h4>Site features and services</h4>
			<p>
				Ponddy Reader uses cookies that provide functionality and help us deliver our products and services — for
				instance, by storing your preferences or by pre-filling the username field when you log in.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Performance
			</h4>
			<p>
				Performance cookies help us route traffic between servers and understand how Ponddy Reader is performing,
				so we can provide you with the best experience possible. We may use third party software development
				kits (SDK) in our mobile apps to collect information about activity in the app, the type of device and
				operating system it is running on and how the app is functioning. For example an SDK may send us a
				report if the app crashes, and reports on which features of the app are used more than others.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Analytics and research
			</h4>
			<p>
				Cookies and other technologies also help us to understand, improve, and research features and content on
				the Ponddy Reader site. For example, we may use cookies to understand how you are discovering projects or
				to determine which types of browsers or devices are accessing Ponddy Reader. You can opt-out of being
				included in Google Analytics
				<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">
					here
				</a>.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Social Media Platforms
			</h4>
			<p>
				Cookies and other technologies make interacting with social media platforms more seamless. For example,
				when you're signed into social media accounts while you use our Services, these technologies enable you
				to share content with your social network or, in some cases, log in using your social media credentials.
				These features are usually controlled by the social media platform you are using and are governed by its
				separate privacy policies and the preferences you set with that service.
			</p>

			<h4>Marketing</h4>
			<p>Cookies help us deliver targeted advertisements on social media platforms, based on your activity on
				Ponddy Reader, including the projects you've backed or creators you've followed on Ponddy Reader, and to
				track the performance of those ads. This is sometimes referred to as online behavioral advertising. In
				some cases, our partners may use cookies to provide us with information about your interactions with
				their services. Those third-party cookies would be subject to the third party service's policies.</p>
			<p>You can opt-out of online behavioral advertising. The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral
				Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior
				recorded and used for advertising purposes. To opt out of having your online behavior collected for
				advertising purposes, click
				<a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/" target="_blank">
					here
				</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Certain choices you make are both browser- and device-specific.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>
			You can control certain cookies
		</h3>
		<p>
			Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie.
			Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. Blocking or deleting cookies may prevent you from
			using most of our Services. To find out more about how to enable, disable, or delete cookies from your web
			browser, please visit here. To control flash cookies, which may be used on certain websites from time to
			time, you can go here. Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Our Do Not Track Policy
		</h3>
		<p>
			Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features
			are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on
			our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.
		</p>
		<p>
			Certain options you select are browser- and device-specific.
